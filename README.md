# 3D Minecraft-alike Game
Description: A 3D game similar to Minecraft was created using the game engine ***Unity3D*** in 2019, for the core course "Computer Graphics and Interactive Systems" for my 
undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Ioannina.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Abstract
The game starts by asking the user to *Enter a number* that will define the dimensions (NxNx1) of the 3D scene.

Automatically, the Level #1 will be generated, that is just a floor that is created by NxN colorful cubes **randomly**. 

The color of the cubes can be ***blue, yellow, red, green*** and ***cyan***.

The cube with the ***magenta*** color is unique and defines the starting position of the Player. 

At the beginning, the Player stands on the *magenta cube* with 4 lives and 100 points. 


The Player cannot exit the limits of the NxNx1 scene. 

The main goal of the game is to create a path so that the Player can reach ***#N-1 Levels*** in ***high***. 

The path can be built by using the cubes that consist the floor of Level #1. 

> Each of the cubes on the floor provide specific reserve:

	**blue: 0 cube(s) reserve**

	**yellow: 1 cube reserve**

	**red: 2 cubes reserve**

	**green: 3 cubes reserve**

	**cyan: 1 cylinder reserve**

> The high of the cubes and cylinders can be converted to the specific Level high:

	**1 cude (1x1x1) : 1 Level high**

	**1 cylinder (1x1x2) : 2 Levels high**
